Problem Statement
There is a HÃ—W-square grid with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left.
Each square is described by a character Ci,j, where Ci,j= . means (i,j) is an empty square, and Ci,j= # means (i,j) is a wall.
Takahashi is about to start walking in this grid. When he is on (i,j), he can go to (i,j+1) or (i+1,j). However, he cannot exit the grid or enter a wall square. He will stop when there is no more square to go to.
When starting on (1,1), at most how many squares can Takahashi visit before he stops?
